# The impact of Foreign Direct Investment on Total Factor Productivity, a propensity score-based estimation analysis

This paper was written as part of a group project in which we examined the potential outcomes of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into a firm. T
here are multiple techniques and outcomes that can be used. Using propensity-score-based estimation, we analysed the impact that FDI has on Total Factor Productivity (TFP). We find a significant positive affect of FDI on Total Factor Productivity, and this finding remains when testing for different specifications.

My role in this paper was to write create, deploy and write up the econometric models (seen in Sections 4 and 5). 

# A Long-Run Structural Model of the UK Economy

This paper was written for my Financial and Macroeconometrics module. Here I build on the study published by Garratt et al., (2003) which developed a long-run theoretical framework for the macroeconomic modelling of small open economies, using the United Kingdom as an example. In my study, reevalute the modelling sequences constructing the Vector Autocorrelation (VAR) models and test the long-run properties. I built on the work by Garratt et al., (2003) by constructing futher models with altered assumptions for cointegrating relations.
